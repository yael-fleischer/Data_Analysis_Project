<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
This Data Analysis project explores the nuances of global happiness, focusing on GDP, perceptions of government corruption, and their impact on societal happiness. We analyze the variation of these factors between European and African countries to understand cultural differences in defining well-being.

# Research Questions:
Is there a statistical difference in happiness levels between Europe and Africa?
How do perceptions of corruption influence happiness in these regions?
What is the impact of GDP on happiness?
Technical Approach:

# Programming Language: 
Primarily used Python for data analysis and processing.
Data Analysis Libraries: Employed Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical calculations.
Statistical Analysis: Utilized SciPy for hypothesis testing and statistical computations.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to effectively present our findings.
Preprocessing: Conducted data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure accurate analysis.

# Key Findings:
No significant statistical difference in happiness levels between European and African countries.
Greater impact of perceptions of corruption on happiness in African countries.
GDP's influence on happiness indicates cultural variations in the perception of well-being.

# Conclusion:
Our project sheds light on the complex factors influencing global happiness, emphasizing the need to consider cultural dimensions in such analyses. The integration of various Python libraries and statistical methods provides a robust framework for this exploration, contributing valuable insights for future research and policy formulation.
